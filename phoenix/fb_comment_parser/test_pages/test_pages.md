# Test pages
There is a large number of exceptions in the html construction of facebook pages.

The `/pretty-analysis-pages` directory contains pages that have been parsed in Beautiful Soup
and saved in a "pretty" format for ease of human reading. They represent most
of the variation in FB pages.

The `/sample_pages` directory contains a wide variety of various FB pages for testing purposes.

## To do
Possibly specify the variation in the different FB elements and signify which page holds them for more accurate testing.
