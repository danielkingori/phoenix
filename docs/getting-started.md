# Getting Started

## Good to read
Before you start it is recommended that you read the documentation:
- [Project Structure and adding a new project](/docs/project-structure.md)

## Setup your development env
It is recommended that you use some sort of vitualisation to setup your development environment.
This repo has two options that are already set up: docker and virturalenv.

See [development.md](/docs/development.md) for more information.
