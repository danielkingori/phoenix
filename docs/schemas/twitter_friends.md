# Twitter Friends

Final Twitter friends dataframe for graphing.


| Column             | Datatype | Description                                               |
|--------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------|
| user_1  | object   | screen name of user account                             |
| user_2  | object   | screen name of person followed by user                  |

*\*This is after running the graphing script, which replaces user_ids with 
screen_names through an API query.*
