# Infrastructure
This folder contains scripts that can be used to initialise infrastructure.

## Setup
You will need to install the aws-cli:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html

Then configure your aws cli to use your aws IAM user credentials (access key id and secret access key).

## Notes:
When you create a new script use ".sh" file extension and run the command:
`find ./ -type f -iname "*.sh" -exec chmod +x {} \;` to make it executable.
